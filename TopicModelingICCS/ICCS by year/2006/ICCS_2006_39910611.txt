Abstract. This paper presents the Evolutionary Geometric Near-neighbor Access Tree (EGNAT) which is a new data structure devised for
searching in metric space databases. The EGNAT is fully dynamic, i.e.,
it allows combinations of insert and delete operations, and has been optimized for secondary memory. Empirical results on diﬀerent databases
show that this tree achieves good performance for high-dimensional metric spaces. We also show that this data structure allows eﬃcient parallelization on distributed memory parallel architectures. All this indicates
that the EGNAT is suitable for conducting similarity searches on very
large metric space databases.

Introduction

Searching for similar objects into a large collection of objects stored in a metricspace database has become an important problem. For example, a typical query
for these applications is the range query which consists on retrieving all objects
within a certain distance from a given query object. From this operation one can
construct other ones such as the nearest neighbors. Applications can be found
in voice and image recognition, and data mining problems.
Similarity can be modeled as a metric space as stated by the following deﬁnitions.
Metric Space. A metric space is a set X in which a distance function is deﬁned
d : X 2 → R, such that ∀ x, y, z ∈ X,
1. d(x, y) ≥ 0 and d(x, y) = 0 iﬀ x = y.
2. d(x, y) = d(y, x).
3. d(x, y) + d(y, z) ≥ (d(x, z) (triangular inequality).
Range query. Given a metric space (X,d), a ﬁnite set Y ⊆ X, a query x ∈ X,
and a range r ∈ R. The results for query x with range r is the set y ∈ Y ,
such that d(x, y) ≤ r.
The distance between two database objects in a high-dimensional space can
be very expensive to compute and in many cases it is certainly the relevant performance metric to optimize; even over the cost secondary memory operations.

For large and complex databases it then becomes crucial to reduce the number
of distance calculations in order to achieve reasonable running times. This makes
a case for the use of parallelism.
The distance function encapsulates the particular features of the application
objects which makes the diﬀerent data structures for searching general purpose
strategies [4]. Well-known data structures for metric spaces are BKTree [3], MetricTree [9], GNAT [2], VpTree [12], FQTree [1], MTree [5], SAT [6], Slim-Tree
[8]. Some of them are based on clustering and others on pivots. The EGNAT
proposed in this paper is based on clustering [10].
In the case of pivots based strategies a set of (usually random) objects are
selected from the database and distances are calculated to organize the pivots in
a, for example, tree fashion. A search query is executed by calculating distances
between the query object and the pivots so that the search space is reduced by
applying the triangular inequality to discard tree branches.
The strategies based on clustering divide the space in areas, where each area
has a center point. Information is stored in each area so that it allows easy
discarding of the whole area by just comparing the query with the center point.
The strategies based on clustering are better suited than pivots ones for highdimensional metric spaces.
Voronoi Diagrams. Consider a set of point {c1 , c2 , . . . , cn }(centers). A Voronoi Diagram is deﬁned as the subdivision of the plane in n areas, one for
each ci , such that q is in the area ci if and only if the euclidean distance
holds d(q, ci ) < d(q, cj ) for each cj , with j = i.
The EGNAT is based on the concepts of Voronoi Diagrams and is an extension
of the GNAT proposed in [2], which in turn is a generalization of the Generalized
Hyperplane Tree (GHT) [9]. Basically the tree is constructed by taking two
selected points (the two children of the root) and distributing the remaining
points according with how close in distance they are to one of the two points.
This is repeated recursively in each sub-tree.
In the GNAT k points, instead of two, are selected to divide the space
{p1 , p2 , . . . , pk }, where every remaining point is assigned to the closet one among
the k points.
Most data structures and algorithms for searching in metric-space databases
were not deﬁned to be dynamic ones [4]. However, some of them allow insertion
operations in an eﬃcient manner once the whole tree has been constructed from
an initial set of points (objects). Deletion operations, however, are particularly
complicated because in this strategies the invariant that supports the data structure can be easily broken with a suﬃcient number of deletions, which makes it
necessary to re-construct from scratch the whole tree from the remaining points.
Experimental results about these issues can be found in [7].
When we consider the use of secondary memory we ﬁnd in the literature a
few strategies which are able to cope eﬃciently with this requirement. Among
the well-know strategies are the M-Tree [5] which has a similar performance to
the GNAT in terms of number of accesses to disk and overall size of the data
structure.

Evolutionary Geometric Near-Neighbor Access Tree

The construction of the initial EGNAT is performed using the GNAT method
proposed by [2], that is
1. Select k points called centers, p1 , . . . , pk .
2. Associate every remaining point with the nearest center. The set of points
associated with every center pi is denoted by Dpi .
3. For each pair of centers (pi , pj ), the following range is calculated,
range pi , Dpj = min{d pi , Dpj }, max{d pi , Dpj } .
4. The tree is constructed recursively for each element in Dpi .
Every set Dpi represents a sub-tree whose root is pi .
Additionally, the EGNAT [10] is data structure in which the nodes are created as buckets in which the only information is the distance to their father.
This allows a signiﬁcant reduction in space used in disk and also allows good
performance in terms of number of distance evaluations. When a node becomes
full of objects it evolves from a bucket to a GNAT node by re-inserting all objects
in the bucket to the new GNAT sub-tree node.
Searching in the EGNAT is performed recursively as follows,
1. Assume that we are interested in retrieving all objects with distance d ≤ r to
the query object q (range query). Let P be the set of centers of the current
node in the search tree.
2. Choose randomly a point p in P , calculate the distance d(q, p). If d(q, p) ≤ r,
add p to the output set result.
3. ∀ x ∈ P , if [d(q, p) − r, d(q, p) + r] ∩ range(p, Dx ) is empty, the remove x
from P .
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until processing all points (objects) in P .
5. For all points pi ∈ P , repeat recursively the search in Dpi .

EGNAT Performance (Sequentially and in Parallel)

In ﬁgure 1 we show results comparing the EGNAT with the M-Tree for both
number of distance calculations and access to secondary memory. These results
show that EGNAT is more eﬃcient than the M-Tree. The results shown in the
ﬁgure were obtained for the best tunning parameters for each data structure (19,
20, 0.4, 0.1, details in references).
We also tested the suitability of the EGNAT data structure for supporting
query processing in parallel. We evenly distributed the database among P processors of a 10-processors cluster of PCs. Queries are processed in batches as we
assume an environment in which a high traﬃc of queries is arriving to a broker
machine. The broker routes the queries to the processors in a circular manner.
We takes batches as we use the BSP model of computing for performing the
parallel computations [11].

Fig. 1. Results for the local index approach

In the bulk-synchronous parallel (BSP) model of computing [11], any parallel
computer (e.g., PC cluster, shared or distributed memory multiprocessors) is seen
as composed of a set of P processor-local-memory components which communicate
with each other through messages. The computation is organized as a sequence
of supersteps. During a superstep, the processors may only perform sequential
computations on local data and/or send messages to other processors. The
messages are available for processing at their destinations by the next superstep,
and each superstep is ended with the barrier synchronization of the processors.
We used two approaches to the parallel processing of batches of queries. In the
ﬁrst case, an independent EGNAT is constructed in the piece of database stored
in each processors. Queries in this case start at any processor at the beginning
of each superstep. The ﬁrst step in processing a particular query is to send a
copy of it to all processors including itself. At the next superstep the searching
algorithms is performed in the respective EGNAT and all solutions found are
reported to the processor that originated the query. We call this strategy the
local index approach.
In the second case, we assume that a single EGNAT has been constructed
considering the whole database. The ﬁrst levels of the tree are kept duplicated
in every processor. The size of this tree is large enough to ﬁt in main memory.

Downwards the tree branches or sub-trees are evenly distributed onto secondary
memory of the processors. A query stars at any processor and the sequential
algorithms is used for the ﬁrst levels of the tree. The copies of the query “travel”
to other processors to continue the search in the sub-trees stored in remote
secondary memory. Note that queries can divided in multiple copies according
to the tree paths that contains valid results. Thus these copies are processed in
parallel when are sent to diﬀerent processors. We call this strategy the global
index approach.
Results for databases formed by natural language text, a large set of points
formed with Gaussian distribution and a collection of images are shown in the
ﬁgure 2. A total of 10,000 queries are processed. The results show that the local
index approach achieves good eﬃciency in parallel. In particular, because of
the relatively larger cost of disk access with respect to communication cost, we
observed super-linear speedups in the results. The speedups for the global index
approach were very similar.

Conclusions

We have described the EGNAT data structure and shown its performance both
sequentially and in parallel.
The results show that this data structure is a good choice for systems large
enough that tree nodes has to be stored in secondary memory. It also allows
insert and delete operations to take place once the tree has been constructed.
For the sequential case the results with diﬀerent databases show that EGNAT is more eﬃcient than the well-known M-Tree both in number of distance
evaluations required to solve range queries and amount of accesses to secondary
memory.
For the parallel setting, the results show that the EGNAT admits an eﬃcient
parallelization. The results for running time show that it is feasible to signiﬁcantly reduce the running time by the inclusion of more processors. This because
of distance calculations takes in parallel during solutions of batches of queries.
We emphasize that for use of parallel computing to be justiﬁed we must put
ourselves in a situation of a very high traﬃc of user queries. The results show
that in practice just with a few queries per unit time it is possible to achieve
good performance. That is, the combined eﬀects of good load balance in both
distance evaluations and accesses to secondary memory across the processors,
are quickly enough to achieve good performance.
