Abstract
With increasing frequency immersive virtual environments (IVEs) are being used to present multi-dimensional information
visualizations. Networks and graphs are a common type of abstract data; in order to understand the varied relationships between
entities in a network, it is crucial to acquire some spatial knowledge about the layout and connectivity of its components. While
there is a good body of evidence for the benefits of IVE displays, most work on the effects of immersion and of navigation on the
acquisition of spatial knowledge has been concerned with wayfinding in realistic environments; much less is known about how to

acquisition of spatial knowledge regarding abstract networks in an immersive virtual environment.

1. Introduction
Presenting complex, abstract scientific data in a clear, easy to comprehend way remains a long standing
challenge. The field of information visualization has come a long way in contributing a rich set of options and is
often utilized to find patterns within such data. However in some specific cases, especially when the information can
be represented as a network graph, users may be best served by gaining knowledge of the spatial organization and
spatial relationships within the data. One such case is cellular signaling pathways, where the structure of
communication pathways may be more valuable than individual properties of any item within the data.

There have been a number of previous studies that evaluate the benefits of immersion for spatial understanding.
Many of these studies have recorded some benefit to immersion when performing particular tasks. In all other cases
immersion seems to have no significant effect. This research serves as an inspiration for the study presented in this
paper. However, all of these previous experiments have studied realistic virtual environments. The study in [1] does
discuss the effects of immersion when viewing abstract information, however, to our knowledge, no previous work
has been done on abstract networks. As defined in [2@ ³DEVWUDFW LQIRUPDWLRQ LV LQIRUPDWLRQ WKDW LV QRW QRUPDOO\

effectiveness of different techniques for navigating three-dimensional networks.
To understand the effects that such changes in immersion and navigation might have for spatial knowledge of
abstract data networks, we designed the experiment described below. To contextualize this inquiry, we refer to the
traditional division of spatial knowledge into landmark, route and survey types. As defined in [3@³ODQGPDUNVDUH
unique objects at fixed locations, routes correspond to fixed sequences of locations as experienced in traversing a
route; survey knowledge abstracts from specific sequences and integrates knowledge from different experiences into
DVLQJOHPRGHO´
Using these distinctions, we designed four tasks: one to test landmark identification, one that required route
following, and two testing survey knowledge. These tasks are performed across four treatments created by varying
the Field-Of-Regard (FOR) in combination with either an egocentric or exocentric navigation technique. We
hypothesize that exocentric navigation will provide users an advantage for acquiring survey knowledge and a good
understanding of the topology of the network, whereas egocentric navigation will enable the user to get better route
knowledge of the network connections. We also suspect increased immersion will facilitate easier cognition in all
spatial categories with the greatest benefit for survey knowledge.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the related work in this research area. In
Section 3 we explain the details of our experiment and presenting the results of the study and a discussion of their
implications. Section 4 contains the conclusion drawn from the performance of this experiment sketches future
research to improve our understanding of how navigation techniques and immersive technologies can impact the
acquisition of spatial understanding of abstract data networks.
2. Related Works
Network visualization has long been a topic of research. Many networks of interest have no physical counterpart
or are too intangible to suggest a natural representation. Also, in many cases visualizing the information associated
with a network is just as important as understanding its structure. One type of network that has been the subject of a
large amount of research are Telecommunication networks. In [4] and [5] network visualization techniques are
developed and discussed in hopes of creating better computer network security tools. The goal of these
visualizations is to provide insight into both the topology of the network (structures and patterns of connectivity) as
well as the local properties of nodes and edges. To address the scalability and effectiveness of visualizing large
networks, they leverage "Overview first, zoom and filter, then details-on-demand" in an interactive two-dimensional
graphic space [6]. A number of design challenges were enumerated including: occlusion, filtering and providing an
interface that enables users to adjust the amount of distortion and suppression in the visualization. Network
visualizations such as these raise the question as to how interactive three-dimensional visualizations and immersive
technologies can be leveraged to improve task performance.
Another type of network is Cellular signaling pathways, which are the system of communication relationships
that allow cells to respond to internal or external biochemical cues. The STKE database was established to store data
on all known cellular signaling pathways [7]. The current online visualization for analyzing this STKE networks is
WKHµ&RQQHFWLRQ0DS¶7KHVHDUHLQWHUDFWLYH'QHWZRrk graphs, which allow for zooming, panning, and details-ondemand. As reported on the STKE website [7], one of the main ways in which these graphical representations are

gaining spatial knowledge of the signaling networks. This led us to consider how traditional research in the benefits
of immersion and navigation would apply when investigating spatial networks of abstract data.
One study that motivated our current experiment is [8], which compared scientific visualizations within
immersive systems such as the CAVE to less immersive desktop displays such as the Fish Tank system. This study

suggested that the CAVE, with its larger display size and field of view, performed better both subjectively and
objectively for examining the scientific information. This study differs from our own in that it used realistic
scientific models and this study changed not only the level of immersion but also the hardware being used to display
the information.
Another motivating experiment is [1]. For this study abstract data in the form of 3D scatter plots were displayed
in the CAVE and immersion was controlled by Field-of-Regard (FOR) and head-tracking. Field-of-Regard refers
degree of surround provided by a display; for example a Head Mounted Display and a six-sided CAVE have 360
degrees horizontal and vertical FOR; two walls in a corner may provide 120 degrees horizontal and 90 degrees
vertical FOR. They found that immersion tended to improve user performance and was preferred by the participants.
This study is similar to our own, however, they did not use network data and their focus was not to determine the
effects of immersion on spatial understanding.
Bowman and McMahan [9] discuss how the benefits of immersion depend on the complexity of the environment
being viewed and hypothesis that Immersive Virtual Environments (IVEs) should assist in the discovery of spatial
knowledge. Following up on this hypothesis, [10] explored the effect of immersion on the spatial understanding of
realistic complex 3D structures. Immersion was controlled by changing FOR, stereoscopy, and head tracking. They
found that a higher level of immersion increases both speed and accuracy when gaining spatial knowledge of
complex 3D structures. Although we hypothesize that we will observe similar results as this study, we believe that
abstract data networks will provide unique challenges when attempting to obtain spatial understanding.
A set of guidelines has been proposed by [9] for designing effective IVE navigation techniques. They are:
absolute motion, relative motion and the amount of disorientation a given technique causes the user. This study
showed that a pointing-based navigation is more effective for relative motion than gaze-based navigation, while they
are equally effective for absolute motion. However, they observed that the gaze-based navigation is easier to learn
and is more accurate than pointing-based navigation. For our experiment we opted for pointing-based navigation
techniques. Despite the benefits of gazed-EDVHGZHIHOWWKHXVHUV¶DELOLW\WRJDLQVSDWLDONQRZOHGJHZDVEHVWVHrved
by allowing them to look around the network structure while moving.
While navigating IVEs, disorientation can be a major issue. [11] explored the use of three-dimensional arrows
and information-on demand techniques to support three-dimensional navigation in a virtual environment. It was

spatial knowledge through exploration and discovery, we must examine new techniques and solutions.
The study in [13] focused on countering disorientation while wayfinding in large virtual environments. They
observed that using environments that provide recognizable structure through coordinate systems or built in
landmarks such as unique coastlines can benefit virtual wayfinding performance. They also noted participants using
orienting techniques typical in the real world, such as dead reckoning and path following. Although this study
focused on large-scale realistic environments, we believe many of their findings are applicable to our experiment. In
order to mitigate disorientation while viewing abstract data networks we provided a compact and organized structure
divided into subgroups of nodes with shared attributes using a modified force-directed layout. In addition we added
a horizon line and sky to serve as a constant plane of reference.
Motivated by the previous work in this field, our primary goal for this project was to assess the impact of
LPPHUVLRQDQGQDYLJDWLRQWHFKQLTXHRQSDUWLFLSDQWV¶DFFXUDF\DQGVSHHGDWDFTXLULQJODQGPDUNVXUYH\DQGURXWH
knowledge of three-dimensional graphs. To do this we conducted an empirical study observing the performance of
participants acquiring knowledge using varying Field-Of-Regard (FOR) in combination with either an egocentric or
exocentric navigation technique. We hypothesize that three-dimensional graph structures representing the cell
signaling pathways will be sufficiently complex to bring out the benefits of immersion. As a result, we expect to see
accuracy and speed increase when using four walls as opposed to one. Also based on the prior work above, we
expect to see improved performance for: egocentric navigation for route discovery and exocentric navigation for
survey knowledge.
While research ([10, 8]) has been done that demonstrates that the differences between men and women as well as
between individuals of different cognitive predispositions can greatly impact the benefits gained from both level of
immersion and interaction technique, we had no hypothesis in this regard.

3. Experiment
We devised the following experiment to assess the impact of level of immersion (FOR) and navigation technique
(ego vs. exo -centric) on user performance during the acquisition of landmark, survey, and route knowledge when a
three-dimensional graph is displayed in a stereoscopic and tracked IVE. During the experiment the threedimensional graphs were shown on either one wall or four walls and the participant navigated using an egocentric
µIO\LQJ¶DSSURDFKRUDQH[RFHQWULFµURWDWing¶PHWKRG
Using the egocentric navigation technique, users flew through the network using forward and backward
movements on the wand joystick that guided the camera in the corresponding direction within the environment
along a vector defined by the heading, pitch and roll of the wand. In other words, as the user pointed the wand in a
direction and held the joystick forward, the camera moved in the direction the wand was pointed. Moving the
joystick to the left or right rotated the camera around the Z-axis. While using this technique, nodes could be
selected, however the selection had no impact on navigation.
With the exocentric navigation technique the user rotated the network about its X,Y and Z axes using the wand
joystick. The pivot point for rotation began as the origin and then became the currently selected node once a
selection was made. Zooming in and out was achieved using the two bottom buttons (left and right) on the wand.
The speed of the zoom was equal to the max speed moving forward or backward while using the egocentric flying
navigation.
It is important to note that we did not allow for roll control in the egocentric flying technique. Therefore, the
egocentric \ technique provided one less degree-of-freedom (DOF) than the exocentric rotation technique. In both of
the navigation techniques, nodes could be selected using the top right button on the wand. A diagram of these
navigation techniques can be seen in Figure 1.
These immersion and navigation options created four separate conditions in which participants could be tested by

the center of the front wall is selected)

Each of the twenty-four participants was tested in three of the four possible treatments. The participant was asked to
answer the same four questions as quickly as possible during each of the treatments.
3.1 Dataset and Representation
The data used for this project was a collection of cellular signaling pathways from the STKE database. Each
pathway represents the interactions of various biochemical components of a cell; these nodes can share multiple
connections with one another (edges) (Figure 2). To maintain a consistent complexity between all of the graphs used
throughout the experiment we chose pathways that each contained between 33 and 42 nodes. This was the most
compact range that would provide the level of complexity and number of graphs required for this experiment. In
addition, different pathways used for the same question between treatments were selected for sharing a similar
number and arrangement of edges.
The graphs representing the pathways were arranged using a modified force-directed layout algorithm. We began
by implementing a typical force-based algorithm using Hooke's law and Coulomb's law. In addition to the basic
form of the algorithm, we also took into account the attributes of the objects being represented. First, we grouped
nodes from the same (physical) location within the cell and ensured that no two of these nodes were ever more than
a given distance away from each other. This initial step resulted in more organized and spatially-grouped networks
as opposed to the more flat graphs created by the unmodified (ungrouped) force-directed algorithm.
We choose our modified algorithm because it created relatively clean three-dimensional structures and
substructures. There are certainly a number of trade-offs in the use of various graph layout algorithms. In particular,
it is clear that the complexity of a network layout is closely related to how easy it is to acquire knowledge about its
spatial properties. We apply the same network layout algorithm to all the stimuli, the how and why these factors are
related is outside the scope of this work and must be left for future work. Our objective is to explore the navigation
and immersion within three-dimensional graphs in general. Therefore we decided to represent only a small number
of additional key features of each node specific to the cell signalLQJSDWKZD\V7KHQRGH¶VSK\VLFDOORFDWLRQZLWKLQ
the cell (e.g. Nucleus, Cytosol, Membrane, etc.) was also represented by the color of the node. At most, a graph
could contain nodes of five different colours. Components (nodes) in the graph were also spatially grouped by the
same cellular location (see above). A Heads-Up-Display (HUD) provided a key for interpreting the colours as well
as providing details about the selected node. In an attempt to reduce user disorientation, we added a horizon line
with a blue sky. An example of the final network representation rendered in the CAVE is shown in Figure 3.

3.2 Participants & Procedure
In total, 24 undergraduate participants were involved in this study covering 16 majors. None of the participants
had any prior experience using the CAVE and all were unaware of the hypothesis of the experiment. Theirs ages
ranged from 18 to 24, and they included 14 males and 10 females. The majority of the participants reported that they
had average PC experience, with males having a slightly higher average PC experience than females. Also, males
self-reported a slightly above-average gaming experience while females self-reported below-average game
experience.
All participants were given an explanation of the experiment, signed a consent form and then given a
demographic questionnaire. The collected information included age, gender, major, PC experience, game
experience, and any prior CAVE experience. Once they had completed the questionnaire they were given a brief
introduction to the CAVE hardware, put on the head-tracked stereo glasses and shown an example cell signaling
graph including the information available in the Heads-Up-Display (HUD). Three-dimensional graph terminology
ZDVH[SODLQHGLQFOXGLQJ³FRQQHFWHGQRGH´³QHLJKERUQRGHV´DQG³SDWKEHWZHHQQRGHV´. Participants were shown
each wand navigation technique and given the chance to practice; when users verbally confirmed they were
comfortable and capable with each technique, the experiment began.
We used a Balanced Incomplete Block Design in this experiment. In such a design, a user participates in only a
subset of all possible treatments, but in a structured way so that a full factorial analysis of variance can still be valid.
This means that each of the 24 participants was treated with 3 out of the four possible scenarios (four wall + flying,
four wall + rotating, one wall + flying, one wall + rotating). While participants were all shown the same graph
environments in the same order, to avoid an ordering effect they experienced different arrangements of treatments,
resulting in unique combinations of treatment and environment. Care was taken so that each treatment was given
equal number of times.
In each of the treatments, the participants were asked to perform the following four tasks:
1. Identify all of the neighbors of node X
(survey)
2. Identify how many nodes are between nodes X and Y
(route)
3. Identify the most connected node in the graph
(landmark)
4. Identify how many nodes of type Z are in the graph
(survey)
These questions were chosen because they require WKHSDUWLFLSDQW¶VODQGPDUNURXWHDQGVXUYH\NQRZOHGJHRIWKH
displayed graph. These questions allow us to test whether the changing level of immersion and egocentric or
exocentric navigation have an impact on the speed or accuracy with which one can gain landmark, route, and survey
knowledge. In particular the first and fourth questions require survey knowledge of the three-dimensional graph,
while the second question involves route knowledge and the third question requires landmark knowledge. In total,
each participant would perform twelve trials (four tasks per treatment). To ensure that every task was independent
and unaffected by the knowledge of the graphs gained from previous tasks, a different cell signaling pathway with
consistent properties was given for each of the 12 trials.
Each task required an answer that consisted of a node name (a four or five digit number) or a count of nodes; for
task 1, the answer consisted of, on average, six nodes. For task 2 the number of nodes included in the answers
averaged out to be 5 nodes. Task 3 had a single answer and the average number of nodes for task 4 was 10.The
participants verbally indicated their answers as they discovered them and stated when they were finished answering.

The experimenter inside the CAVE recorded the answers as they were given and the time spent answering was
recorded once the participant indicated they were finished with that question. If the participant made an error that
they explicitly corrected, then their incorrect answer was ignored; otherwise their responses were recorded exactly
as given. After completing the all of the tasks, participants filled out a post-experiment questionnaire asking them to
rate their display and navigation preference and the difficultly of each question (on a scale of one to seven).
3.3 Results
The following section describes the results of our study. We present the results of the objective measures,
subjective measures, and the demographic questionnaire. Statistical results are derived using Analysis of Variance

qualitative observations about user strategies and behaviors. Scores across all tasks have been normalized to a
percentage of 100.
3.3.1

Objective

We began by assessing the overall effects of the task (the type of spatial knowledge required) on both time (p <
0.0001) and score (p < 0.0001). For structural Survey knowledge (task 1) the average score was 90% correct in
79.79 sec. For counting Survey knowledge (task 4), average score was 87% in 39.90 sec. For Landmark tasks (task
3) it was 100% in 40.79 sec. For Route knowledge (task 2) correctness averaged 53% in 86.23 sec.
We performed a three-factor ANOVA for the dependent measures of user response time and score. Participants
tended to be faster (p = 0.0613) on Route knowledge using one wall; Users completed task 2 on average in 75.97
seconds (Standard Error (SE) = 7.68) while it took on average 96.49 seconds (SE = 7.87) when using four walls.

Fig. 4: (a) Mean times to complete Task 2 using one wall (75.97 sec.) and four walls (96.49 sec.); (b) Mean scores for Task 2 using each of the
four treatments. 1 wall/flying (0.66), 1 wall/rotating (0.44), 4 wall/flying (0.33), 4 wall/rotating (0.66); (c) Mean score for Task 4 when using
flying (0.97) and rotating (0.77)

FOR in combination with navigation technique yielded significant differences in the score for task 2 (p =
0.0157). Participants scored significantly better on task 2 while using a combination of one wall and flying with an
average score of 0.66 (SE = 0.114) or while using 4 walls and rotating together with the same score and standard
error; for one wall/rotating and four wall/flying, the average scores were 0.44 (SE = 0.120) and 0.33 (SE = 0.114).
Another significant result was observed when we considered the effects of immersion and navigation together. It
shows participants scored significantly (p = 0.01) better on task 4, which tested their survey knowledge, while using
flying as opposed to rotating with average scores of 0.972 (SE = 0.027) and 0.77 (SE = 0.070) respectively. Other
than these three conditions, level-of-immersion (FOR) and navigation technique did not significantly impact speed
or accuracy in any other treatments. Figure 4 shows these significant results.
3.3.2

Subjective

We analyzed the responses given in the pre and post experiment questionnaires. Display preference was strongly
correlated to both PC experience (R = 0.641, p < 0.0001) and gaming experience (R = 0.624, p < 0.0001). In other
words, those participants with more gaming and/or PC experience significantly preferred four walls. In addition,

1744

J.A.G. Henry, N.F. Polys / Procedia Computer Science 1 (2012) 1737–1746
Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2010) 000±000

navigation preference was strongly correlated to PC experience (R = -0.2902, p < 0.0001), meaning users with more
PC experience preferred the exocentric (rotating) navigation technique.
We also attempted to discover any correlations between the objective and subjective measures. We found that
while performing task 2 (route) using four walls, score was significantly associated to the display preference (R =
0.349, p = 0.036). This means that participants who scored better on task 2 using four walls recorded liking four
walls as opposed to one. We also found within task 4 (survey) that participants who responded more quickly while
using the flying technique also recorded a preference for flying (R = -0.341, p = 0.041). Finally, for task 4, better
scores under exocentric (rotation) navigation correlated with higher PC experience (R = 0.333, p = 0.046).
3.3.3

Observations

While performing the study we observed and noted common user behaviours. One of the most significant
observations was the strong tendency for participants to maintain focus on the front wall - even when there was
imagery on four walls. Because of this orientation forward, users navigated in a way to bring regions of interest
from other walls to the front wall. In addition, the majority of participants made little physical motion within the
CAVE despite being shown that they were free to move about.
Also of interest are observations regarding participant actions within the virtual environment. Users were
conservative in their navigation of the space and rarely lost sight of the network in any treatment. While attempting
to gain survey and landmark knowledge, users tended to navigate away from the graph so that more of it would be
visible. This behaviour was most prevalent in the landmark task (task 3) and the survey counting task (task 4). On
some tasks (especially the structure survey task (task 1) and the route task (task 2)), users adopted a strategy for
wayfinding that takes advantage of a noGH¶V VHOHFWHG VWDWH WR SURYLGH Dn obvious, user-defined landmark. This
highlighted node can then serve as a visual reference while navigating.
3.4 Discussion
We hypothesized that exocentric navigation would provide users an advantage for acquiring survey knowledge
and an overall understanding of the topology of the network, whereas egocentric navigation would enable the user to
gain better route knowledge of the network connections. We also suspected that increased immersion would
facilitate easier cognition in all spatial categories with the greatest benefit for survey knowledge. It is not surprising
that time varied significantly depending on the task being performed. While designing the study we were aware that
some tasks are more complicated than others, indeed normalized accuracy scores differed significantly. This
suggests that some spatial knowledge of abstract networks, such as route understanding, is more difficult to attain
than landmark or survey knowledge (in a static 3D graph).
In our route task, users were given a starting node and a target node and asked to count the hops between them.
On single wall displays, we observed a trend towards faster performance on route knowledge tasks. This conflicts
with our hypothesis that more FOR would better support route tasks. Recall that users generally maintained their
focus on the front wall. This may explain the result if they were able to complete this task (follow the route) only on
the front wall (where all their attention was), all that is left in the increased FOR is irrelevant information. As a
consequence, users do not seem to naturally take advantage of the increased FOR for this task. Because our
environments are abstract, users cannot easily leverage the perceptual strategies they may use in the real world.
Indeed, the spheres, lines and text in our stimuli do not provide many cues for differentiation or recognition. Thus,
for extracting route knowledge from our presentations, it seems that there is some task time overhead when
presenting information with a large FOR.
However, participants scored equally well on the route task using one wall with egocentric flying as with four
walls with the exocentric rotation technique. In the egocentric navigation, the user is moving relative to the nodes
and thus users have to track or re-find the route while exploring the environment. Because participants
predominantly focused on the front wall, they adopted a navigational strategy that could keep the target route on the
front wall. As a result, when using flying, the side and floor walls serve mainly as a distraction - resulting in more
frequent loss of the focus route. This can explain our observation that egocentric flying for routes is more accurate
with one wall rather than four.

In contrast, with exocentric navigation the user rotates about a stationary selected node; therefore if the target
route is on the front wall it stays on the front wall and the user does not have to track or re-find it while exploring. In
this case, the user has a stable point of reference (recall the user is required to select a node as the pivot point) and
the peripheral information provided by the extra FOR can be moved and explored without fear of losing the focus
route. Therefore exocentric navigation makes searching for the route in question on four walls easier while not
adding unnecessary maneuvers. The results show this combination of navigation technique and FOR is a top
competitor for accuracy.
In opposition to our original hypothesis, participants responded more accurately on task 4 (survey knowledge)
while using the egocentric navigation technique. Recall that for this task many participants navigated away from the
graph in order to attain an overview. We suggest that this advantage for the egocentric technique is due to the
ergonomics of the device mapping we used: in the egocentric technique, no buttons were required to complete any
navigation intent. In contrast, the switching between joystick and buttons for an exocentric zoom navigation was
costly. Once the participant could see the entire graph, they could insure that all of the nodes of a particular type had
been located.
It is also interesting to note that the some participants tended to perform more accurately on task 2 (route) and
significantly quicker on task 1 and task 4 (survey) across all conditions. This suggests that especially for survey
knowledge (and to a lesser degree route knowledge), individual differences seem to be a big factor in performance.
A more thorough questionnaire would be helpful in narrowing down which of these individual differences are
significant.
We believe the correlation between PC experience, gaming experience, and display preference for four walls can
be attributed to better skills at managing attention in high stimulus environments and better competency in
navigating virtual environments. These characteristics allow those with PC and/or gaming experience deal with the
complexity of the abstract network being displayed without becoming overwhelmed. The connection between PC
experience and a preference for the exocentric rotating navigation could be a result of these participants being
accustomed to viewing and manipulating their PCs from exocentric points of view. The final set of results shows
that in many cases users reported liking the conditions that they perform with best. This suggests to us that in these
conditions users are able to recognize their own ability to gain spatial understanding.
4. Conclusions & Future Work
The effect of Field of Regard and navigation technique on the acquisition of spatial knowledge of abstract data
networks is clearly an issue that requires more attention. In many cases, utilizing human intuition of their
surroundings gained through spatial understanding may be the key to discovering new insights into complex and
abstract scientific data. This study has worked to better understand the benefits that immersive virtual environments

Our results suggest that IVE designers should consider task and navigation technique together with the display
venue. This study has shown that different navigation techniques can be advantageous for different search and
integration tasks. For example, to obtain accurate and timely route knowledge of such abstract networks, users
should able to maintain focus on the data relevant to their task with as little effort as possible. This becomes
especially important in immersive (high FOR) environments. Also we note that even in graphs of modest
complexity, it may be beneficial to provide additional orienting cues for the user; for example more salient
landmarks in the background and/or periphery. In addition it seems that user experience can have a large impact on
how users perform with various navigation techniques and FOR to acquire different kinds of spatial understanding.
These results help shed light on the effects of screen surround and navigation technique when viewing abstract
data networks in immersive virtual environments; the fact that some results of this study do not support our initial
hypothesis highlights the need for more research in this area. We sample only two navigation techniques and one
regime of network size and connectivity. A separate but related study could also be done focusing on the impact of
network layout algorithms on spatial understanding in IVEs. Undoubtedly there are more rich relationships to
discover. In response to our specific results, we hope to perform further studies to better understand the effects of
