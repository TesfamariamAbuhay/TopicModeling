Abstract. The Heider theory of cognitive dissonance in social groups,
formulated recently in terms of diﬀerential equations, is generalized here
for the case of asymmetric interpersonal ties. The space of initial states
is penetrated by starting the time evolution several times with random
initial conditions. Numerical results show the fat-tailed distribution of
the time when the dissonance is removed. For small groups (N =3) we
found some characteristic patterns of the long-living states. There, mutual relations of one of the pairs diﬀer in sign.

Introduction

The Heider theory of cognitive dissonance in social groups was formulated in
1944 [1,2] in terms of relations between triad members. A state is deﬁned as
balanced when the following four conditions are met: a friend of my friend is my
friend, an enemy of my friend is my enemy, a friend of my enemy is my enemy,
an enemy of my enemy is my friend. In an unbalanced state, group members
suﬀer from the cognitive dissonance and they try to remove it. It was proven
in terms of the graph theory [3] that a fully connected network is balanced if
and only if it is divided into two antagonistic groups, with all relations between
the groups positive and all intergroup relations negative. The question if the
state of balance is ever attained remains open. It is likely that the answer does
depend on the assumed dynamics. Most authors consider the model when the
set of possible states is limited to a positive (friendly) and negative (hostile)
one, sometimes including zero (neutral or lack of contact) [4,5,6,7]. In the time
evolution, these states are changed sharply. In fact, the balanced state is attained
in all investigated cases, if only the ties were present between all group members
and they were properly informed on the relations in the group. The case of
incomplete information was discussed in [4].
Recently, the model was reformulated in terms of a continuous change of ties,
governed by diﬀerential equations [8,9,10]

where xi,j (t) is the time-dependent relation of i to j, and g(x) is a function to
bound the relation x within some prescribed range. Advantages of this modiﬁcation are that i) there is no ambiguity due to the order of modiﬁed ties, and ii) the
condescription is more realistic from the psychological point of view. Also, when
this approach was applied to some commonly discussed examples (”the women
of Natchez” [11] and ”the Zachary karate club” [12]), the results were the same
as the best obtained in literature [10]. In particular, the division of the group of
34 club members obtained theoretically was the same as observed by Zachary
[12,6]. Numerical realizations of the system dynamics indicated, that there are
two stages of the system. During the ﬁrst – yet unbalanced – stage the relations vary slowly in an apparently incoherent way. At the end of this stage they
appear to be at the edge of balance, with only some ties to be changed. Then
the time evolution is accelerated in the sense that the number of unbalanced
triads abruptly decreases. Once the balance is attained, the time derivative of
each relation is of the same sign as this relation. Then, the absolute values of xij
increase till their limits, which depend on the function g(x). However, the shape
of this function seems not to inﬂuence directly the ﬁrst stage of the balancing
process.
Here we generalize the approach to include a possible asymmetry of ties, when
the relation of i to j is not necessarily the same as the relation of j to i. This
asymmetry reﬂects the fact that the social relations are never perfectly reciprocated [13] ; therefore, our generalization reﬂects the actual human behaviour.
We ask, if the introduced asymmetry generates any new pattern of the system
behaviour. In particul1ar we are interested, if imbalanced states can persist.

The Calculations and the Results

Looking for generic solutions, we average the results over a set of initial values
of xij selected randomly from a narrow range (−δ, δ). The same method was
applied previously [8] for the case of symmetric ties. These results suggested
that in the as-yet imbalanced stage, the values xij remain small. On the other
hand, the essential mechanism of removing the cognitive dissonance is captured
by Eq. 1 even if g(xij )=1 for all ties. Trying to keep things as simple as possible,
we use either g(x) = 1, or g(x) = 1 − (x/R)2 with R of the order of 104 , whereas

Once the number of imbalanced triads falls to zero, the calculation is stopped.

As for our experience, once the system is balanced it remains balanced. The
percentage of cases, when the balance is not attained within time T , is given in
Table 1 for various N . The total number if simulated trajectories is 106 for all
values of N .
In Fig. 1 we show the probability distribution of the time τ when the balance
is attained. The obtained curves indicate that the distribution functions decrease
as power functions ρ(τ ) ∝ τ −α , with the exponent α dependent on the number
N of nodes. The values of the exponents are given in Table 1. The percentage

of the cases when τ < T oscillates with N but decreases for N = 7; we deduce
that the power distribution appears only for small N .
Searching for typical trajectories with large τ , we noticed that indeed some
characteristical patterns appear which seem stationary or close to stationary. As
the number of curves xij (t) to be investigated depends on N as N (N − 1), it
is easier to investigate the case when N = 3. Often, large τ is produced where
the curves are similar to those in Fig. 2. There is also a regularity in the Fourier
transforms of the selected curves. As a rule, the spectra can be divided in two
groups, and those within a group are practically the same. Two spectra belong
to one group, and four spectra – to the other. These two belong to the ties which
join the same nodes, e.g. x12 and x21 . The spectra are shown in Fig. 3. Similar
situation is found for N = 4. In this case, there are three diﬀerent patterns of
the Fourier spectra, as shown in Fig. 4. As a rule, ties with similar spectra join
diﬀerent nodes, e.g. x12 and x34 belong to the same pattern.
In the simplest case of N = 3, these numerical results suggest an approximate analytical solution of Eq. 1. Let us suppose that x23 = −x32 = ω,
xij = aij cos(ωt) for the tie i, j = 1, 2 and xij = aij sin(ωt) for the tie
i, j = 1, 3, where is a small parameter. Substituting this to Eq. 1, we get
that a12 = a13 and a21 = −a31 . The corrections to x23 and x32 are of the order of 2 , and to the other x s – of 3 . We can deduce that either sign(a12 ) =
sign(a21 ) and then sign(a13 ) = −sign(a31 ), or sign(a12 ) = −sign(a21 ) and then
sign(a13 ) = sign(a31 ). The numerical results conﬁrm these sign rules. Also, the
Fourier spectra show that the frequency of the corrections to x23 and to x32 are
characterized by the frequency two times larger than the basic frequency characterizing other x s. This rule comes directly from the above parametrization,
as x˙ 23 ∝ sin(2ωt).
Some insight is possible also for N = 4, where the pattern of the time evolution
is the same for xij and xji . In this case, all six ties are divided to three pairs, e.g.
(1, 2) + (3, 4), (1, 3) + (2, 4), (1, 4) + (2, 3). Suppose we denote these sets as a, b
and c. Then the time evolution of ties a are governed by the product of elements
of b and elements of c. Writing it as a˙ = bc, we have also b˙ = ca and c˙ = ab. This
regularity is observed in the simulations, and Fig. 4 is typical in this sense.

Discussion

As follows from Table 1, the exponent α is not universal, as it depends on N . However, as can be deduced from Fig. 1, there is no characteristic scale of time at least
for small number of nodes N . Translating this result to the social psychology, the
time τ of removal the cognitive dissonance can be, at least in principle, arbitrarily
long. We note however that our tool – the numerical simulation – does not allow
us to state that in some cases, the balance is not attained. On the other hand,
the analysis of the trajectories indicates, that the large values of τ are due to one
(N = 3) or two (N = 4) pairs of ties which are permanently of diﬀerent sign. This
rule could be written symbolically as an old exercise for beginneers in Latin: Agricola amat puellam. Puella non amat agricolam [14]. The lack of reciprocity seems

to create the lack of balance; other ties oscillate around zero and therefore they
are not able to change the situation. As a consequence, some stable or metastable
patterns appear. Their persistence depends on N , and it seems to be relatively
weak for N = 5. We deduce it from the fact that in this case the observed times
τ are relatively short. This can be due to topological properties of the fully connected graph of N = 5 nodes. The result suggests, that the symmetries like those
discussed above for N = 3, 4 cannot be preserved for N = 5.
Trying to draw some conclusion for the social psychology, where the original
concept of the Heider balance has been formulated, we can refer to some attempts
to interpret within the Heider model examples drawn from history or literature.
In Refs. [3,15], a ﬁctitious situation is analysed with four persons: Hero, Blackheart, Buddy and Goodman. In the ﬁnal balanced state Blackheart proved to
the remaining three that they should act together. The asymmetry which maintained the evolution was that Buddy liked Blackheart. Non-reciprocated love as
a motif is able to keep the action unsolved and reader’s attention vivid for long
time [16,17]. To kill the murderer of his father, Hamlet had to destroy Ophelia’s
love, as he was not able to implicate her in the conspiracy [18]. More generally,
the unbalanced state is of interest as opposite to an open conﬂict. It is known
that to activate enmity, one has to kill a commonly accepted person, as Mohandas Gandhi, Martin Luther King or Yitzhak Rabin. This method makes the
situation clear for warriors. The case even more fraught with consequences –
international relationships in Europe from 1872 to 1907– was mentioned in the
context of the Heider balance in Ref. [19]. In fact, Otto von Bismarck maintained
equilibrium by a set of bilateral relations, binding hostile states [20]. Last but
not least, the message Love Thy Enemies [21] can be interpreted as a desperate
attempt to prevent the hate from spreading. These examples suggest that in
conﬂict preventing, some asymmetric ties can be essential.
